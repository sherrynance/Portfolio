# Sherry Nance: Portfolio

This Portfolio shows my work related to web design and development.

This Portfolio was built from scratch using HTML and CSS.

### Things I've learned:

-How to better line up divs in HTML by using flex-boxes.

-How to style FontAwesome icons in CSS.

-I do not really like talking about myself.

### I am hoping to add:

-A JavaScript feature.

-A better color scheme.

-A different arrangement of the items now that I understand FlexBox even more.
